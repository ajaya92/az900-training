You can purchase Azure access directly from Microsoft by signing up on the Azure website ([Azure.com](https://azure.com)) or through a Microsoft representative. You can also purchase Azure access through a Microsoft partner.

### What is the Azure free account?
The Azure free account includes free access to popular Azure products for 12 months, $200 USD credit to spend for the first 30 days, and access to more than 25 products that are always free.

## [Exercise - Create an Azure account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/3-exercise-create-an-azure-account)

To create and use Azure services, you first need to sign up. If youâ€™ve never tried or paid for Azure before, you can sign up for the Azure free account.

You'll need a valid credit card to create your Azure free account. **This card is used for identity validation only**. Your card *won't be charged* until you choose to upgrade.

## [Understand Azure billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/4-multiple-subscriptions)

 You'll receive a monthly invoice with payment instructions provided. You may organize your invoice into line items that make sense to you and meet your budget and cost tracking needs. You also can get set up for multiple invoices.

An Azure subscription is a logical container used to provision resources in Azure.

You might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management purposes.
